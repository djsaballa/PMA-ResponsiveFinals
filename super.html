       <h2>MAJOR GENERAL LEOPOLDO L. MALIGALIG</h2>

       <div class="float-right">
        <img src="/img/super/super-pic.jpg" alt="Major General Leopoldo Lawas Maligalig" style="padding-left: 20px;">
       </div>

       <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The 51st Superintendent of the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) and the first-ever “in-house” PMA officer to have been appointed directly to the top post of his alma mater… Maj. Gen. Leopoldo Lawas Maligalig – the 3rd of four brothers who are proud members of  “the long gray line” – ascended to the highest post of the PMA nearly 30 years after his graduation as a cadet in 1976.</p>
        <p> Only 53 years old, MGen Maligalig will not just be passing through at PMA as superintendent, as President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo herself told Baguio-based reporters last summer. Gen. Maligalig is the first PMA Superintendent to have been “consciously put there for a long-term assignment – it is there where he will earn his stars.</p>
        <p>True enough, Maj. Gen. Maligalig – then a brigadier general and the Commandant of Cadets of the Cadet Corps Armed Forces of the Philippines (CCAFP) for fifteen months – was appointed as PMA Superintendent on January 30, 2006, and then was given his second star two months later.</p>
        <p>A product of the University of the Philippines System in his younger years, Gen. Maligalig – known as “Doo” to his family and friends, and as “Pol” to others– obtained his elementary and high school education at the UP in Los Banos, where he was born on November 15, 1952 to parents Modesto, a retired Army officer, and Maria, a former teacher and a native of the resort town. </p>
        <p>His father, who fought and survived in Bataan in World War II as a young lieutenant, would have a profound influence on the huge family of nine children as all the boys found PMA calling. Stories about the nobility of the profession of arms reverberated in the Maligalig home. In school, the children earned a reputation for academic excellence and leadership through the inspiration and example of their parents. </p>
        <p>A member of PMA Class 1976, 2Lt Maligalig's first assignment was to be one of the pioneers in the newly organized 37 Infantry Battalion of the Second Infantry Division, where he served as platoon leader, company executive officer and assistant operations and training officer. </p>
        <p>After taking his basic training in Field Artillery, the young lieutenant would be hastily recruited into the Presidential Security Command to join the 11th Special Forces Company that he would later serve as Commanding Officer from late 1980 to Feb 25, 1986.   </p>
        <p>Even before the euphoria of EDSA I had subsided, then Capt. Maligalig was sent abroad to take up the Public Affairs Officers Course at the Defense Information School (DINFOS) at Fort Harrison, Illinois, USA.  A natural communicator, this schooling would later prove to be a most productive credential for the future spokesman.  </p>
        <p>It was in his days as a captain that he would come to the attention of many of his superior officers. Determined to “toe-the-line” and “go back to basics” after his training, he was appointed as the operations and training officer of the Army's Honor Guard Battalion that he had helped train and organize as the 62nd Infantry Battalion in Fort Magsaysay.  </p>
        <p>He would not stay long in the battalion though as he was recruited to join the office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Plans, G-5, and later to be a pioneer in the new office for Education and Training, G-8, of the Army. Here he did not escape the attention of, among others, the then Colonel Arturo Enrile, Army Chief of Staff, who would later become PMA Superintendent, Commanding General of the Philippine Army, and then Chief of Staff of the AFP.</p>
        <p>Soon after the tumultuous events of 1989, Capt Maligalig volunteered to go to Mindanao and joined the 402nd Infantry Brigade, 4ID in Agusan del Norte. He would have a very short stint as brigade operations officer as the Commanding General of the 4ID handpicked him to take over the command of the 53rd IB as officer-in-charge only a few weeks after getting his promotion to major. </p>
        <p>Having accomplished his mission to end a near- mutinous situation and put the battalion back on its feet, the Army leadership recalled him to Manila to take up the Pre-Command Course for Battalion Commanders in 1990. Then Major Maligalig would distinguish himself not only as the most junior of the selected would-be commanders but also as one of only seven “highly-recommended” graduates in a class of fifty colonels and field grade officers.</p>
        <p>He would rejoin the 4ID after the all-important training to become the division's Assistant Chief of Staff for Education and Training, G-8, in 1991. Later that year, he was given command of the 28th Infantry Battalion operating in the NPA-infested towns of Agusan del Sur and Surigao del Sur.  </p>
        <p>Before the middle of 1993, he would be recalled to Manila to Army headquarters where he would become the Army Spokesman and Chief of the Public Information Office. </p>
        <p>Soon after his promotion to the next higher rank, LtCol Maligalig would be appointed as the PIO, GHQ, where he served under General Arturo Enrile, the Chief of Staff, until the latter's retirement in November 1996. </p>
        <p>Then already 20 years in the service of arms, LtC L Maligalig would be sent to Australia for a year-long Command and Staff Course (CSC) at the Australian Army Command & Staff College that started in early 1997. While there, he also concurrently completed his Masters in Defense Studies at the University of Canberra.  </p>
        <p>Upon his return, LtC Maligalig would have a stint in the summer of 1998 as the Commandant of the Combat Arms School (CAS), Training & Doctrine Command (TRADOC) at Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija. This would last only for two months as he was again handpicked by the Commanding General of the Army, LTGEN Raul Urgello, to be the Army's Chief, Public Affairs, (ACPA) and, for the second time, as Army Spokesman. </p>
        <p>Capitalizing on his former experience as PIO, GHQ, LtC Maligalig crafted a comprehensive communications plan for the Army whose theme captured the Army's very essence for being: “At your service across the land.”    </p>
        <p>For his media-related accomplishments, LtC Maligalig was awarded the Gawad Oscar M. Florendo 1999 Outstanding Information Tool (Annual Report) by the Public Relations Organization of the Philippines (PROP).   </p>
        <p>He would later become Secretary of the Army General Staff, where he continued to contribute in “marketing” the Philippine Army and figured actively in the reconstruction of the Philippine Army Museum. </p>
        <p>Shortly after his promotion to colonel in 1999, he was appointed as the Army's Assistant Chief of Staff for Education and Training, G-8, PA under LTGEN Voltaire T Gazmin. There, he instituted a more responsive education and training program while reinvigorating the Army's Division Training Units (DTUs) and Army Training Groups (ATGs). </p>
        <p>He would figure actively in the preparation for the country's hosting of the Asean Army's Rifle Meet (AARM) in 2001. This major activity prompted his reassignment to be the Chief of Staff of the 7th Infantry Division in Fort Magsaysay, site of the AARM. </p>
        <p>Running against time and severe budgetary constraints, Col Maligalig orchestrated and administered the preparations for the biennial meet that became a complete success. </p>
        <p>While at the 7th ID, his public affairs skill was again tapped for the conceptualization and construction of the AQUINO-DIOKNO MEMORIAL, a national shrine honoring the two late senators who were incarcerated in Fort Magsaysay during Martial Law.</p>
        <p>His having been a member of the Army general staff, plus his having been a division chief of staff, served him in good stead. In the middle of 2001, he was appointed as Brigade Commander of the 4th Infantry Division's 402nd Infantry Brigade in Prosperidad, Agusan del Sur.</p>
        <p>It was a homecoming of sorts for Col Maligalig who – for close to three years from 1990-1993 – was in the area in various capacities for the 4ID. His mission: Immediately reverse the alarming trend of the communist insurgent threat in Agusan del Sur, southern Surigao del Sur, portions of Compostela and northern Davao Oriental. With the 28IB, his former battalion, and the 29IB and 36IB under his command he buckled down to work. </p>
        <p>Soon the mining “headache” area of Mount Diwalwal was stabilized. By literally opening the doors of his headquarters to the lumads in Agusan, he listened, brokered dialogues, and empowered the lumads to solve some of the long-drawn problems. He worked closely with the local government officials and government agencies to orchestrate a holistic approach to insurgency in the area and help alleviate poverty. </p>
        <p>Combining the “left-hand” effort through tangible programs like the “balik-baril” and the 29IB's innovative housing and livelihood programs, the 402 Brigade did not let up in its “right-hand” effort of combat operations. </p>
        <p>Soon enough, the brigade was reaping the rewards from its hard work as NPAs and their supporters began coming back to the folds of the law, giving up their firearms and their armed struggle and starting life anew. For this accomplishment, the brigade earned the highest mark under the AFP “grading system” nationwide.</p>
        <p>This exemplary feat did not go unnoticed. After only 14 months as a Mindanao returnee, Col Maligalig was singled out by the Board of Generals to earn his first star. </p>
        <p>In fact, his promotion to brigadier general on October 20, 2004 would even be topped by his appointment as Commandant of Cadets of the CCAFP four days later – thus completing his homecoming to his alma mater. </p>
        <h3>FROM COMMANDANT OF CADETS TO PMA SUPERINTENDENT:</h3>
        <p>Ensconced in the position of Commandant of Cadets for fifteen months, it seemed inevitable for Brig Gen Maligalig – beloved by the Cadet Corps, what with his approachable ways and cheerful demeanor – to become the next superintendent of the PMA.</p>
        <p>And that is exactly what he became upon the retirement on January 30, 2006 of Lt. Gen. Cristolito Balaoing, his predecessor, and his former commanding general over at the 4th Infantry Division. </p>
        <p>MGen L Maligalig is happily married to Mrs. Josephine Dayrit-Maligalig with whom he has two children: Leo Joseph, a Management Information System graduate of the Ateneo de Manila University; and Jan Christine, a Hotel & Restaurant Administration graduate of the University of the Philippines in Diliman, Quezon City.</p>
